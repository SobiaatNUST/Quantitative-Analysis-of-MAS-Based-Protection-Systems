This subdirectory contains PRISM codes for the Traditional Algorithm.

This case study is based on the relay, circuit breaker, and DG-based protection algorithms.

The test system comprises four operation zones and there is a separate file for the analysis of faults in each operation zone.

It is used for the probabilistic analysis of the protection algorithm used in MAS-based systems.
