This subdirectory contains PRISM codes for the Auxiliary Algorithm Part B Supporting MAS-Based Systems.

This work was initially proposed by B.Fani et al in [1].

This case study is based on the digital relay, circuit breaker, and DG-based protection algorithm.

The test system comprises four operation zones and there is a separate file for the analysis of faults in each operation zone.

It is used for the probabilistic analysis of an auxiliary protection algorithm used in MAS-based systems.
