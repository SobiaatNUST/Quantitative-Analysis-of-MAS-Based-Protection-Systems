**Abstract:**
<p align="justify">
 Protection systems in power distribution networks (PDNs) are responsible for monitoring the electrical networks, detecting faults, and tripping the breaker to isolate the faulted section 
 of the network. Ensuring reliability and safety in Multi-agent systems (MAS) based protection systems is vital for the smooth functioning of PDNs during emergency situations. Therefore,
 we propose to use probabilistic model checking, a formal verification technique, to provide a framework for the analysis of Multi-agent systems (MAS) based protection systems. In this 
 regard, we have developed formal Markovian models of protection system components that can be used to model, analyze, and verify MAS-based protection systems. To illustrate the usefulness of 
 the developed models, we have used them to verify and compare the reliability and safety of an auxiliary algorithm with the conventional protection algorithm using the PRISM model checker.
 The results show that the auxiliary algorithm is more reliable and safer than the traditional algorithm.
